The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

CODE:

def hammingDistance(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        x=x^y
        count=0
        for i in range(0,32):
            if not x&(1<<i)==0:
                count+=1
        return count
